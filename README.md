https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-024-03387-y

Data files can be downloaded from /data/.

The files in /model_inputs/ calculate the age structure, clinical fraction, and contact matrices for the analysis, alternatively the outputs from these files are also in /data/.  model_inputs/loading_data.R is sourced at the start of later files, and loads many of the necessary files and functions.  

Results of the study are produced in files in /outcomes/, mainly in outcomes/results.R. The epidemic model is in outcomes/SEIRD_model.R.
